# Notation fonts (SMuFL)

Place additional SMuFL notation fonts here (e.g. Bravura, Petaluma) if you want abc2svg to use them.

Licensing:
- Before committing or shipping any font file, verify its license is compatible with redistribution.
- Keep the license text alongside the font (or document it in `NOTICE.md`), per the font’s requirements.

ABCarus / abc2svg usage example (in an ABC header or via Settings → Header → Global header):

```abc
%%musicfont url("../../assets/fonts/notation/Bravura.otf") 24
```

See `docs/notation-fonts.md` for details.
