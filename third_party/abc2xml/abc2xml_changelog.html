	* Revision: 268
	- add beam elements to grace notes when appropriate
	- new function delElm keeps xml indentation when deleted element happens to be
	the last one

2025-11-08

	* Revision: 267
	- discard inlinefieds between two notes in detectBeamBreak
	- remove now redundant ad-hoc replacement of 'I:staff ' in MusicXml.parse

2025-11-02

	* Revision: 266
	- count number of grace notes, excluding &lt;chord/&gt; notes
	- use grace attribute of the note instance (pObj) to record this number of
	grace notes (in parse action doGrace())
	- use the number of grace notes to set the fixed unit length (8 or 16) while
	translating the duration (in function mkNote)

	* Revision: 265
	- bug: continuation is considered to add an extra space

2025-10-06

	* Revision: 264
	- make the Res class compatible with python 2.7
	- make regex b1 compatible with pythone 2.7
	- replace \r\n with \n after decoding the input file
	- set encoding of the ouput file/stream to utf-8 explcitly, to avoid cp1252
	problems on Windows (for the compiled exe-version, that is now using
	python3.12 internally)

2025-10-04

	* Revision: 263
	- updated compilescript

2025-10-03

	* Revision: 262
	- removed dependency on pyparsing
	- added functions and classes for evaluating parsing expressions
	- small adaptations of the ABC grammer

	* Revision: 261
	- corrected truth value tests for elements of ElementTree that caused
	deprecation warnings (for python 3.13 and higher)

2025-09-03

	* Revision: 260
	- use names defined the General MIDI standard (percussion included) when
	creating &lt;instrument-name&gt; elements
	- when an instrument (number) not in the GM-range use "no name"

2025-04-25

	* Revision: 259
	- update documentation
	- new function scanEdo scans all accidentals and sets the temperament to edo12
	or edo53. The result can be overridden with %%MIDI tempermentequal 36
	- translate fractional accidentals with denumerator 3 as up/down accidentals
	(for files with accidentals from both edo36 and edo53, as created by xml2abc
	--temp=2)

2025-04-23

	* Revision: 258
	- this version also replaces ^8 and _8, for which no superscripted versions
	exist, by notes with equivalent pitch, lowering or raising the nearest step
	with one comma.

	* Revision: 257
	- new option --mus53 that replaces Arel-Ezgi accidentals by superscripted
	normal ones. The superscriped accidentals appear to be played at the correct
	pitch by musescore. Also, this option adds explicit notated accidentals to
	each and every note that was altered, either by the key or by a previous
	alteration in the same measure. This is necessary because musescore ignores
	the normal accidental rules for all microtonal accidentals, whether
	temporary or in the key.

2025-04-15

	* Revision: 256
	- bug: chords or annotations with spaces caused beam break when between
	beamed notes
	- bug: do not sort explicit key alterations
	- added makam abc files for edo36 and edo53 to the regression set

2025-04-13

	* Revision: 255
	- seach for "%%MIDI termperamentequal nn" to determine the tuning
	- change accTab to several tuning mappings
	- MusicXml.edo variable stores the tuning identification
	- change getAlter and getAcc to accommodate multiple tunings
	- add abc2xml to software identification

2025-03-06

	* Revision: 254
	- added global s.nid that holds the current ABC note for better error
	messages
	- changed global dicts into access functions: s.getAcc, s.getAlter with error
	messages
	- moved decTupAcc into classMusicXml for better error messages with s.nid
	- included __ and ^^ in regex for alterations for K:

2025-03-05

	* Revision: 253
	- small change in alterAction with respect to the effect of slashes
	- removed redundant brackets from regex "altre" (in doFields, K:)

2025-03-04

	* Revision: 252
	- new partial grammer for accidental list (for K:)
	- new function decTupAcc() to decode parsed microtonal accidentals
	- added microtonal accidentals to alterTab and accTab
	- key alterations and temporary alterations are remembered as accidentals and
	not als alterations (alter =&gt; acc in msreAlts and keyAlts)
	- scan K: for microtonal accidentals with new partial grammer
	- update generation of &lt;key&gt; element with explicit accidentals and alterations

2025-03-02

	* Revision: 251
	- key alterations not reset on each voice when the header K: has no key

2025-02-28

	* Revision: 250
	- add sharp, sharp-sharp, flat, flat-flat to accTab
	- add corresponring accidentals _5, _9, ^4, ^9 to alterTab
	- in function parse (): initialize attrmap ['K'] with pObj
	- improve parsing of key field: allow key 'none', allow any word (except a
	clef name) as mode for the tonic, but only valid mode names are translated

2025-02-26

	* Revision: 249
	- added parsing grammer for K: (including microtonal accidentals)
	- new function decTupAcc() to decode microtonal accidentals
	- added definitions in alterTab and accTab
	- changed representation in msreAlts and keyAlts: accidentals replace
	alteration values
	- changed key processing in doFields to deal with the new parse results of K:
	- corrected the list of key-octave elements
