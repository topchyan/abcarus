	* Revision: 173
	- bug: option wev was missing in function vertaal()

2025-10-26

	* Revision: 172
	- also translate slurs when they start or end in a grace sequence

	* Revision: 171
	- translate note types of grace notes
	- for grace notes map types to abc durations respecting the fixed unit length
	that is used by acb2svg: L=1/8 for single grace notes, L=1/16 for multiple
	grace notes

2025-10-20

	* Revision: 170
	- handle staff changes in sortMeasure and not in the main parse loop,
	because in sortMeasure all concurrent voices/staves have already been parsed
	and only then can staff changes reliably be detected.
	- add xml staff- and voice number to the Note class
	- add xml staff number to the Elem class
	- new function elemToNewVoice() that alse inserts staff changes when needed in
	addition to Note- or Elem- instances that are appended
	- sortMeasure also deletes a staff change when present before an overlapping
	rest when that rest is deleted

2025-10-16

	* Revision: 169
	- new function emptyStaves() that creates an invisible rest in an otherwise
	empty staff. Allows voices to switch to an empty staff. An empty staff
	automatically sets option --wev.

	* Revision: 168
	-- corrected truth value test for element of ElementTree that caused a
	deprecation warning (for python 3.13 and higher)
	-- added translation of sound/instrument-change/score-instrument as used by
	musescore
	-- improved code for overlapping notes in one voice that changes these notes
	into chords

2025-04-25

	* Revision: 167
	- documentation updated

2025-04-20

	* Revision: 166
	- better rebeam (for 5/8 and 7/8)
	- new option: --nbr, do not use broken rhythms in ABC code generation
	- bug rebeam: for a beam both current and previous note need to have a
	duration &lt; 1/4
	- add general option parameter to regression04/py

2025-04-15

	* Revision: 165
	- bug: place initial key in the header if transposition/chromatic is a
	multiple of 12. Otherwise, if chromatic transposition is different from a
	multiple of 12, place the key in the current voice only and not in the
	header.

2025-04-13

	* Revision: 164
	- bug: also scan key-accidentals to determine the tuning
	- include abc2xml in the search for software identification

2025-04-09

	* Revision: 163
	- new option --rbm to re-beam all measures
	- clean up: use a new measure data object for each measure and keep a
	reference in array maatRecs

2025-04-06

	* Revision: 162
	- For the burak encoder the absence of an accidemtal element seems to signal
	a natural accidental when the particular pitch is altered in the key.
	(except for grace notes that always seem to follow the key). This change is
	provisional.

2025-03-13

	* Revision: 161
	- added auto value (-1) to --fin and remover --nofin
	- renamed edomix to edomap and reused edomix for fractional edo36 values
	- new option --temp (0=auto choice edo: 12, 36 or 53, 1=force edo53 and map
	edo36, 2=use fractional edo36 values when mixing edo 53 and 36
	- only autodetect encoder when microtonal accidentals present
	--fin=3 always show accidentals and ignore pitch-alter (finale)
	--fin=2 use musescore rules for accidentals (musescore)
	--fin=1 same as 2 but always use current alteration when no pitch-alter
	(burak)
	--fin=0 same as 2 but also honor microtonal pitch-alter values
	--fin=-1 automatic detection of encoder if finale or burak, otherwise
	musescore

2025-03-09

	* Revision: 160
	- option --fin, when set pitch-alterations are ignored for microtonal
	accidentals This seems to be the logic presently followed by finale and
	musescore
	- auto-detect musescore/finale and set --fin if detected
	- option --nofin disables auto-detection

2025-03-06

	* Revision: 159
	- when a tune uses %%MIDI temperamentequal 36, replace ^3 by ^ and _3 by _
	(because 3*12/36 == 1)

2025-02-17

	* Revision: 158
	- added a couple of regression test files with microtonal accidentals

	* Revision: 157
	- bug in return value of alt2acc when float alter value
	- accept floating alter if +/-1.0, 0.0 or +/-0.5
	- do not add natural (converted from alter) if no current alteration (or key
	alteration)
	- (test function) better option handling in regression04.py

2025-02-16

	* Revision: 156
	- change internal representation of accidentals to the corresponding
	MusicXML textstings. (mapping double-flat to flat-flat and the same for
	sharp)
	- recognize Edo36 accidentals (natural-up, sharp-down etc.) and translate them
	to _4, _3, ... ^3, ^4 (flat-down, flat, .. sharp, sharp-up)
	- new option "no36" to map Edo36 accidentals to Edo53: most up/down variants
	are mapped to quarter-sharp and quarter-flat
	- new functions acc2abc and alt2acc to support the new internal representation
	of accidentals

2025-02-10

	* Revision: 155
	- accidental type natural-up/down added
	- proper error message when accidental type not supported
	- also accept musicxml extension within .mxl files

2025-02-05

	* Revision: 154
	- follow probable bug in Musescore: hide accidental when alteration is
	defined in a key-step element, even if an explicit accidental element is
	present. When the key is defined by a &lt;fifths&gt; element the accidental is not
	hidden when the same alteration is in the key!
