# Kitchen (local-only)

This folder is for **private/local working materials** used during development:
- reference docs / standards snapshots
- chat exports
- scratch notes / experiments

By policy, everything under `kitchen/` is **not committed** (see `.gitignore`).

Suggested layout:
- `kitchen/refs/` — external reference docs (standards, manuals, screenshots)
- `kitchen/chat-exports/` — local chat transcripts
- `kitchen/notes/` — private notes / drafts
